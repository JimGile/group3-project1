## Data to compare
* Men vs women number of gold, silver and bronze medals (both summer and winter)
* Top 10 countries GDP and their top respective top 10 events
* What is the numerical relationship of top 5 highest awarded medal countries, and lowest 5 for happiness, GDP and nutrition
* What is the correlation # of these?


## Hypotheses
* There is a definitive correlation between happiness and medals won : *disproven*
* There is a definitive correlation between GDP and medals won : *proven*
* Healthier countries will produce better athletes : *inconclusive*


## Data
* Number of countries we compared (247 countries total)
* ____ Total number of events
* 103 countries received a medal for Summer games : Women
* 136 countries received a medal for Summer games : Men
* 36 countries received a medal for Winter games : Women
* ____ countries received a medal for Winter games : Men
* Number of countries with a medal vs without


## Analysis
* US skews all the data
* When comparing correlation we removed the outliers and largest awarded to find a more manageable number, and while there were some changes,
primarily we found little correlation between the olympics and nutrition or happiness. Happiness had the least correlation, despite our hopes.
* We found a slight correlation between GDP and the Olympics, this is strengthened in correlation with the highest awarded countries (USA, Russia, etc) included,
as these countries also have higher GDPs we can infer a probable correlation of GDP to medals won (likely have greater means to invest in their athletes)
