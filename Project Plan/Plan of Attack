For a beginner AI project exploring the Olympics using pandas, Python, and exploratory data analysis (EDA), you might consider examining several types of correlations and insights. Here are some ideas:
Medals by Country:
Correlation between GDP and Medal Counts: Compare the GDP of countries with their total medal counts to see if wealthier nations tend to win more medals.
Medals vs. Population: Examine if there's a correlation between a country's population size and the number of medals won.
Performance Trends Over Time:
Changes in Medal Counts Over Decades: Analyze how the total number of medals won by countries has changed over time and identify any trends or patterns.
Improvement in Specific Sports: Look at the performance of countries in specific sports over different Olympics to see if certain countries are improving or declining.
Event Popularity and Success:
Correlation Between Event Popularity and Success Rates: For individual sports, see if more popular events (with more participants) have higher or lower success rates in terms of medals won.
Gender Disparities: Analyze medal counts for male and female athletes to identify any gender-based trends in performance.
Country-Specific Analysis:
Correlation of Medal Types: Investigate if certain countries have a higher proportion of gold medals compared to silver or bronze medals.
Geographic Influence: Examine if countries from certain regions (e.g., Europe vs. Asia) have different success rates in various sports.
Athlete Performance:
Age and Performance: Analyze the ages of athletes and their medal counts to see if thereâ€™s an optimal age range for winning medals.
Number of Events Participated in: Look at whether athletes who participate in more events tend to win more medals.
Host Country Effect:
Impact of Hosting on Performance: Investigate if host countries tend to perform better in the Olympics compared to their usual performance.
